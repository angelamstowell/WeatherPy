The temperature is higher around the equator.

Cloud coverage doesn't have a direct correlation to temperature near the equator. However, there are clusters of datapoints around 100, 80 and 20 degrees. This implies in temperatures that deviate from temperate measures, there is more wind.

Humidity is also higher near the equator. This makes sense, as moisture in the air can capture and persist heat.
