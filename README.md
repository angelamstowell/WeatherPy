The temperature is higher around the equator.

Cloud coverage doesn't have a direct correlation to temperature near the equator. However, there are clusters of datapoints around 100, 80 and 20 degrees. This implies in areas where temperatures deviate from the middle of the range, there are more clouds.

Humidity is also higher near the equator. This makes sense, as moisture in the air can capture and persist heat.
